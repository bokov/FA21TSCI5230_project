# Group project for TSCI5230


**Good news**: You have been invited to be part of Prof. Elemental's grant-writing
team. He sent each of you a COP comitting to 75% coverage of your salary, which 
will impress the promotion & tenure committee and make your department chair 
very happy with you. _If_ this grant gets funded, of course.

**Bad news**: The grant is due  December 15th.

**Good news**: You're only responsible for the preliminary data section.

**Bad news**: The previous data science team was suddenly hired away by Epoch 
Corporation, signing some kind of nasty non-compete agreement which prevents 
them from talking to Professor Elemental or any of his collaborators (i.e. you).
All they left behind was this repo on GitHub that Professor Elemental managed to
fork before they deleted it: https://github.com/bokov/FA21TSCI5230_project

**Good news**: This is the day for which the Translational Science & Clinical
Investigation Program has been preparing you! You got this. Maybe you don't 
remember every single bit of information from your classes, but you are not 
alone-- you're working with three other excellent investigators-- they might 
remember the parts you forgot and vice versa. Furthermore, you can use Google,
various R and Python help files, and any other source of information you can
find.

Instructions:

* The file `Grand_Draft.docx` needs to be completed with the highlighted 
  information. Instead of manually editing this file, you should 
  generate a dynamic version of it using RStudio or some other means, as long as 
  the original text is preserved, the format is reasonably similar, and of 
  course you fill in the requested information.
* Submit your changes as pull requests to the 
  `bokov/FA21TSCI5230_project` repository on GitHub. The course director will 
  play the role of Professor Elemental and accept your pull requests (or 
  in some cases request changes before accepting). 
* When the project is complete, this repository should contain everything needed
  to verify your results by running your scripts as-is. It should also be 
  possible to run your scripts on different input data (in the same format) 
  without having to edit any files _in this repository_.
* Though `FA21_TSCI5230_project.py` contains useful information, you don't have
  to do the whole project in Python. You could pull the data into R and do some
  or all of the analysis there. You could even replace the Python script with
  equivalent R commands and not use Python at all.
* As a team, make a list of tasks that need to be done to complete
  the preliminary data section for this grant. Make note of which tasks depend
  on which other tasks. You could use 
  [GitHub issues](https://github.com/bokov/FA21TSCI5230_project/issues) to 
  manage these tasks.
* If you are not working on a task, pick one from the list and check it off 
  when you are done. Then choose another task. You can also add tasks to the 
  list as you realize they are needed.
* We've been light on homework this semester, but for this final project you are
  expected to put in some work between classes and communicate with each other 
  in order to avoid duplicating effort and to help classmates out when they get
  stuck.
